# pedpancan_ecdna
Contains working code, scripts and data for the Chavez Lab pedpancan project. Not yet public.  
Tested on an Apple M2 Pro chip and 16Gb RAM running macOS Sonoma 14.5.  

## Installation

(Almost) all code is in jupyter notebook format. Packages and dependencies are installed using `conda`.  For instructions on how to set up conda on your workstation, see [Setting up your workstation](https://github.com/chavez-lab/protocols/tree/main/Setting_up_your_workstation). Dependencies should be clearly indicated in the first cell of each notebook. To install a conda environment from a .yml file, run
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## TODO from S. Danovi
- Include multiome data analysis
- Is it ecDNA or just amplification?
